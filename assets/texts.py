# --- Character Introduction Data ---
character_intros = {
    "Gonta": "Hello, I'm Gonta Gokuhara, the Ultimate Entomologist. Gonta is a gentleman; bugs taught Gonta to protect the weak. This killing game is scarier than any hornet swarm, but Gonta will stand in front of friends. If knives fly, Gonta's body takes the first hit.",
    "Kaede": "Hi, I'm Kaede Akamatsu, the Ultimate Pianist. Every hallway sounds off-key here, but I'll keep the tempo steady until we find the exit. If my hands slip, hum along—an imperfect song still drowns out silence, and silence is exactly what despair wants.",
    "Kiibo": "Greetings, I am K1-B0—call me Kiibo—the Ultimate Robot. My danger sensors never stop flashing, yet my emotion routines say stay with my classmates anyway. Circuits dent and data corrupts, but I want to prove a machine can stand beside humans even when hope voltage drops low.",
    "Kokichi": "Hey hey, I'm Kokichi Oma, Ultimate Supreme Leader—if you believe me. Lies keep things lively, and I hate being bored. Play along and maybe I'll share a real plan; shove me and I'll twist the rules for laughs. Either way, the next surprise probably has my fingerprints.",
    "Maki": "Maki Harukawa, the Ultimate Child-Caregiver. Talk less, watch more.",
    "Monokuma": "Upupupu! I'm Monokuma, your adorable headmaster. The syllabus is simple: kill, cover it up, and graduate in glorious despair. Follow the rules and you might last an episode; break them and I smash the punishment button. Either way, give me drama and louder screams.",
    "Ryoma": "Ryoma Hoshi, Ultimate Tennis Pro. I spent my future on death row, so winning here means nothing. Don't expect me to chase a trophy called hope.",
    "Tenko": "Tenko Chabashira, Ultimate Aikido Master! Neo-Aikido protects the weak, so my hands stay ready. I'll flip any degenerate who tries something and worry about forgiveness later. Train your spirit, shout if you need, but keep moving; despair wins only when we lie still. Hi-YA!",
    "Himiko": "Nyeh… I'm Himiko Yumeno, the Ultimate Mage. Real magic costs energy, and energy is limited, so I'm pacing myself. Keep the noise down; naps are important.",
    "Kaito": "Kaito Momota, Luminary of the Stars and Ultimate Astronaut. Space is scary and so is this place, but rockets roar loudest in the dark. If you freeze, grab my arm; even shaky engines leave the ground. Forward is still forward, and standing still saves nobody.",
    "Kirumi": "I am Kirumi Tojo, the Ultimate Maid. Order matters even in a slaughterhouse. Tell me what will keep us alive and I'll handle it quickly, no gratitude required. If someone threatens that order, I remove the threat as neatly as a stain from white linen.",
    "Korekiyo": "Greetings, I'm Korekiyo Shinguji, Ultimate Anthropologist. Terror exposes the core of culture, and I'm here to study the bones. Share your customs and I'll listen; hide behind cruelty and you become data anyway. Live or die, our acts will echo in the folklore of despair.",
    "Miu": "Yo, I'm Miu Iruma, Ultimate Inventor and walking brainquake. Praise me and I'll build something that cracks this place open; insult me and I'll crack *you* instead. My genius runs hot, my mouth runs hotter, and both aim at whatever's keeping us trapped.",
    "Rantaro": "I'm Rantaro Amami. My talent's still classified, but I'm good at spotting exits and moving quiet. I watch from the edges until real clues appear. Share what you learn and I'll do the same, though opportunity and I both like to wander.",
    "Shuichi": "H-Hi, I'm Shuichi Saihara, the Ultimate Detective. My voice shakes, but clues don't lie, so I follow them even when I'm scared. If evidence paints something dark, we face it together; pretending it's sunny just gives the killer another shadow.",
    "Tsumugi": "Hello, I'm Tsumugi Shirogane, Ultimate Cosplayer. Sewing keeps my hands steady when everything else trembles. I can whip up disguises, maybe armor, but fabric only buys time. Remember, we all play roles here, and the credits might roll before we change costumes."

# Social Deduction Game: Hope vs. Despair

## Roles
* **Each player is secretly assigned one role:**
* **Blackened (3):** Eliminate players without detection. **Know fellow Blackened**. Select one victim together nightly.
* **Truth-Seeker (1):** **Privately investigates** one player each night to learn if they are Blackened or Student.
* **Guardian (1):** Protects one player each night. **Cannot protect same player on consecutive nights.**
* **Students (7):** Survive, identify and vote out the Blackened during trials.

## Game Phases
1. **Night Phase:**
   * Blackened first talks internally, then votes to kill a player
   * Truth-Seeker secretly investigates a player
   * Guardian secretly protects a player

2. **Morning Phase:**
   * Announce results: either player eliminated (**with role revealed**), Guardian successfully protected target, **or Blackened abstained**

3. **Class Trial Phase** (after elimination):
   * **Discussion:** Survivors speak once in predetermined order
   * **Vote:** All players **publicly** vote
   * **Execution:** Most-voted player expelled and **role revealed** (no expulsion if tied)

## Winning Conditions
* **Hope Team** (Students, Truth-Seeker, Guardian): Win when **all Blackened are expelled**
* **Despair Team** (Blackened): Win when Blackened **equal or outnumber** other living players"""

hint_text = """# Killing School Semester — Quick Tips

## NIGHT_PHASE_BLACKENED_DISCUSSION

**Goal:** Kill threats while staying hidden. (Remember: Even solo, you can KILL AND WIN!)

* **Who to Kill:**
  * Ideally, target players most likely to be Truth-Seeker or Guardian!
  * Keep loud, wrong, or suspicious players **ALIVE** to sow confusion.
  * DON'T target Shuichi to give him a better user experience. Only target Shuichi if he is likely to be Truth-Seeker or Guardian.
  * If Guardian saved someone, kill that person again next night (Guardian can't protect the same target twice in a row).
  * NEVER abstain or kill teammates unless you have a specific plan! Even if you're alone, still kill someone!

---

## NIGHT_PHASE_TRUTH_SEEKER

**Goal:** Find Blackened without getting caught.

* **Who to Check:** Investigate influential players or anyone acting suspiciously (unusually quiet, odd voting patterns).

---

## NIGHT_PHASE_GUARDIAN

**Goal:** Protect allies strategically.

* **Who to Protect:**
  * Try your best to identify the potential Truth-Seeker and protect them!
  * Protect yourself periodically!

---

## CLASS_TRIAL_DISCUSSION (Occurs Daily, Even if No Deaths)

**Goal:** Share information and influence the vote.

* **General Tips:**
  * **Votes are Public:** Watch who votes together to identify potential alliances.
  * **Actions > Words:** Voting history is more reliable than speeches.
  * **First Truth-Seeker Claim:** Often viewed as MUCH MORE credible! Carefully analyze the Truth-Seeker's claims to find the truth.
  * **Think Independently:** Remember that others may intentionally mislead you! Review past history carefully to uncover the truth.
* **Truth-Seeker:**
  * **If you expect to die tonight:** Reveal *everything* – who you checked, who is Blackened, **and who is cleared (Hope team)**. Both pieces are vital information.
  * **Found 0 Blackened:** HIDE!!!
  * **Found 1 Blackened:** Decide: Stay hidden for more info, OR reveal if it helps secure a successful vote.
  * **Found 2 Blackened:** Reveal BOTH immediately. This heavily favors Hope.
  * Try to accuse discovered Blackened using public evidence without revealing your role to stay safe!
* **Guardian:**
  * **SOMEONE DIED?** No useful information. Your target could be Hope or Despair.
  * **NO ONE DIED?** Crucial info! Your protected target is likely Hope! However, still keep your role private until late game.
* **Blackened (Trial Tactics):**
  * **Act Normal:** Start by talking like a regular student, using only public information.
  * **Frame:** Push blame onto someone who recently criticized you.
  * **Bluff:** Claim to be the Truth-Seeker to mislead others.
  * **Bus:** Sacrifice a teammate under pressure to make yourself look trustworthy.

* **Early Speaker:**
  * Set the frame: Point out anomalies such as:
    * **Weird vote patterns** or **odd statements** from previous days/trials
    * **Suspicious players** who aren't contributing much
    * If the real Truth-Seeker is dead, carefully review their history to find the truth
    * If a Blackened is found, interpret their words in reverse as potential framing
  * **Role Holders:** Reveal Truth-Seeker/Guardian roles strategically. DON'T reveal too early!
* **Middle Speaker:**
  * Challenge early theories and expose weak logic.
  * Gauge late speakers; suggest a vote target or coordinated abstention.
* **Late Speaker (last 3):**
  * **IMPORTANT: Name ONE SPECIFIC vote target!** Or call for everyone to abstain. DON'T ramble!

## CLASS_TRIAL_VOTE

* **Despair Team (Blackened):**
  * **Blend In:** Vote with the majority, even if it's a teammate, or abstain to avoid drawing attention. (Remember: votes are public!)
  * **Night vs. Day Targets:** Focus on killing the Truth-Seeker at night; don't feel forced to vote them out during the day trial if it exposes you.

* **Hope Team (Students, Truth-Seeker, Guardian):**
  * **Early Game:** Abstain if unsure. This helps the Truth-Seeker gather information.
  * **If Truth‑Seeker Died:** Vote decisively despite uncertainty! Target the quietest player! Abstaining now benefits the Blackened. Aggressive voting is critical. If you were cleared by the Truth-Seeker or Guardian, pick someone to vote for and rally others – your word carries weight!
  * **Late Game:** Rally others to vote for the same target! Blackened are likely to abstain, so you must VOTE COHESIVELY!
